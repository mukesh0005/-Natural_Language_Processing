Part of Speech Tagging (POS) is the process of assigning a part of speech to a word. By doing so, you will learn the following: 

Markov Chains

Hidden Markov Models

Viterbi algorithm


Markov chains :

Really important because they are used in speech recognition.
They're a type of stochastic model that describes a sequence of possible events.
A Markov chain, can be depicted as a directed graph

Markov property states that the probability of the next event only 
depends on the current event.

Transistion matrix:
All of the transition probabilities in each row should add up to one.
the sentence has a 40% chance to start as a noun, 10% chance to start with a verb
 and a 50% chance to start with another part of speech tag. 

 Hidden Markov Models:

 The name Hidden Markov model implies that states are hidden or not directly observable.


Emission probabilities : These describe the transition
from the hidden states of your Hidden Markov model, 
which are parts of speech to the observables or the words of your corpus.


Calculating Probabilities :

To calculate the transition probabilities,
 you actually only use the parts of speech tags from your training corpus.
