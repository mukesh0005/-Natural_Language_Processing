Building the model

1. Identify the misspelled word
When identifying the misspelled word, you can check whether it is in
the vocabulary. If you don't find it, then it is probably a typo.


2. Find strings n edit distance away

Edit : an operation performed on a string to change it.

An edit is a type of operation performed on a string to change it into another string. 
Edit distance counts the number of these operations so that the n edit distance tells you how many operations away one string is from another.

There are 4 main edit options:

1.INSERT
2.DELETE
3.SWITCH
4.REPLACE



3. Filter candidates
In this step, you want to take all the words generated above and 
then only keep the actual words that make sense and 
that you can find in your vocabulary.


4.calculate worth probabilities

To calculate the probability of a word in the sentence you need to first calculate the word frequencies.
In addition you want to count the total number of words in the body of text or corpus.
The probability of any word within the corpus is the number of times the word appears divided by the total number of words.

find the word candidate with the highest probability and choose that word as the replacements and that's it.



--- ------  Minimum edit distance

For calculating minimum at a distance you will use three types of edits operations.
All three operations that you already know inserts delite and replace.

edit cost :

Insert - 1
Replace - 2
Delete - 1

Note that as your strings get larger it gets much harder to calculate the minimum edit distance.
Hence you will now learn about the minimum edit distance algorithm!
This is called Dynamic Programming.
